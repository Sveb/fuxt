### Global
Nav items donâ€™t blur

See Home bottom grid images for example of the blur hover state

### Home
Video at top, 50vh.

Little symbols around the site are HTML codes, not SVGS.

Work block, on hover go orange, desaturate, and blur.

View More is actually a link to /work/

For the bottom grid, 4th block is always a text block. Note on mobile its totally different. 

Bottom grid is just ALL artists on the site.

### Footer
Links blur on hover, see mockups

### Work
Same grid as home page

### Artists

On hover, blour out other names, and color change, image and keywords show.

### Artist Reel
Allow them to pick grid column count, 2 or 3 columns.

### Work Detail

Two options:
Gallery: The gallery on right, they can pick what image is full width. Vimeo could also be at the top.
Case study:  Image at top, then The Ask, What We Did, Credits, Our Alchemy probably best as ACF fields.
